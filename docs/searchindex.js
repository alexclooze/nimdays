This way it is possible to send multiple commands to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step. This is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use since many decades. For instance many POP3 protocol implementations already supported this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\nRedis supports pipelining since the very early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.

Youtube Lecture Explanation from geeksforgeeks WHITE : Vertex is not processed yet. Initially all vertices are WHITE. GRAY : Vertex is being processed (DFS for this vertex has started, but not finished which means that all descendants (ind DFS tree) of this vertex are not processed yet (or this vertex is in function call stack) BLACK : Vertex and all its descendants are processed. While doing DFS, if we encounter an edge from current vertex to a GRAY vertex, then this edge is back edge and hence there is a cycle.
