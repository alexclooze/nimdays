GRAY : Vertex is being processed (DFS for this vertex has started, but not finished which means that all descendants (ind DFS tree) of this vertex are not processed yet (or this vertex is in function call stack) BLACK : Vertex and all its descendants are processed. While doing DFS, if we encounter an edge from current vertex to a GRAY vertex, then this edge is back edge and hence there is a cycle.
